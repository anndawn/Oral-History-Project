                              By interpreting the students’ work of the OHP, I argue OHP make students
                              more aware of the historical roots of their living condition.
                              Some township students conducting OHP discovers positive perspectives of their community.
                               OHP also cultivates tolerance, respect and a sense of social justice in students.
                              While tolerance and respect prepare students for demorcratic participation.
                              The sense of justice could motivate them to participate in public affairs that could bring up social changes.
                              These shows OHP could play a vital role in civic education.

                      being deprived of their rights, or being punished too severely--the preference for fairness is involved,
                      and this may transform empathic distress into a feeling of injustice, including motivation to night the wrong.</p>

                        Apartheid has been removed from the law-books, but after 20 years is it really gone?
                        Are we a truly integrated country? Is our past just a reflection our present? Do you think there is evidence of the separation today?
                        Is current South Africa better than the Apartheid era and how so?” </p>
                      <p class="lead">The real story is what the government of today does with the freedom, with apartheid society needed to remember who
                        they are and with liberation they need to remember whom they want to be.
                        So we must never forget that there is a huge gap between the haves’ and
                        the have-nots and for the poor like myself it does not mean if we do not have we do not have the right to quality education.    </p>
